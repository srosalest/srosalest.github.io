In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

- [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com)
- [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com)
